Yes, other Azure AI services also support customer managed keys. Azure AI services offer multiple options for customers to manage keys, such as using Azure Key Vault, customer-managed keys in Azure Key Vault or customer-managed keys through Azure Storage service. This helps customers ensure that their data is secure and access to their services is controlled.
